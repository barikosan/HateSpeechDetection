# HateSpeechDetection
This project proposed two different approaches which are traditional vector-based approach and novel transformer-based approach to detect the hate speech from the language users use in their social media posts. 
Compared to traditional vector- based models, transformer-based models differentiated hate related content more efficiently with respect to several evaluation metrics. 
Finally, posts that contain hateful speech are further analyzed and categorized into 7 groups: "Nationality", "Ethnicity", "Religion", "Gender", "Sexual Orientation", "Disability" and "Class" to gain a better perception of the source of the hate.
